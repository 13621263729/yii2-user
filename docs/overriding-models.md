# Overriding models

When you are creating application with Yii2-user you can find that you need to override models or forms. This guide
describes how you can override any model used by Yii2-user. Moreover you can attach any behavior or event handler to any
model. This is possible because Yii2-user uses
[Dependency Injection container](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/master/docs/guide/concept-di-container.md).

Assume you decided to override user class and change registration process. Letâ€™s create new user class under `@app/models`.

```php
namespace app\models;

use dektrium\user\models\User as BaseUser;

class User extends BaseUser
{
    public function register()
    {
        // do your magic
    }
}
```

In order to make Yii2-user use your class you need to override it somewhere (in your config or bootstrap files):

```php
\Yii::$container->set('dektrium\user\models\User', 'app\models\User');
```

## Attaching event handlers

You can attach event handlers as follows:

```php
Event::on(\dektrium\user\models\User::className(), \dektrium\user\models\User::AFTER_REGISTER, function () {
    // your handler
});
```

## Attaching behaviors

In order to attach behavior you need to override model and then attach behavior as usual.
